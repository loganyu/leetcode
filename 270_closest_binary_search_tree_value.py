'''
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:

Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
Example:

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: 4

        return closest
