'''
Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.

Example :
Input: 
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
Note:

All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].

        for word in words:
            it = iter(word)
            heads[ord(next(it)) - ord('a')].append(it)
        for letter in S:

            heads[letter_index] = []
            
            while old_bucket:
                it = old_bucket.pop()
                nxt = next(it, None)
                if nxt:
                    heads[ord(nxt) - ord('a')].append(it)
                else:
