/*
 * Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.



Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= k <= nums.length
nums[i] is 0 or 1
