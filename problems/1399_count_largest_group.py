'''
You are given an integer n.

Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits.

Return the number of groups that have the largest size.



Example 1:

Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            key = sum([int(x) for x in str(i)])
            hashMap[key] += 1
        maxValue = max(hashMap.values())
        count = sum(1 for v in hashMap.values() if v == maxValue)
        return count
