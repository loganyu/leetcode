'''
You are given a string num which represents a positive integer, and an integer t.

A number is called zero-free if none of its digits are 0.

Return a string representing the smallest zero-free number greater than or equal to num such that the product of its digits is divisible by t. If no such number exists, return "-1".



Example 1:

Input: num = "1234", t = 256

Output: "1488"

Explanation:

The smallest zero-free number that is greater than 1234 and has the product of its digits divisible by 256 is 1488, with the product of its digits equal to 256.

Example 2:

Input: num = "12355", t = 50

Output: "12355"

Explanation:

12355 is already zero-free and has the product of its digits divisible by 50, with the product of its digits equal to 150.

Example 3:

Input: num = "11111", t = 26

Output: "-1"

Explanation:

No number greater than 11111 has the product of its digits divisible by 26.



Constraints:

2 <= num.length <= 2 * 105
num consists only of digits in the range ['0', '9'].
num does not contain leading zeros.
1 <= t <= 1014
