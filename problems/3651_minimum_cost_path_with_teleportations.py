'''
You are given a m x n 2D integer array grid and an integer k. You start at the top-left cell (0, 0) and your goal is to reach the bottom‐right cell (m - 1, n - 1).

There are two types of moves available:

Normal move: You can move right or down from your current cell (i, j), i.e. you can move to (i, j + 1) (right) or (i + 1, j) (down). The cost is the value of the destination cell.

Teleportation: You can teleport from any cell (i, j), to any cell (x, y) such that grid[x][y] <= grid[i][j]; the cost of this move is 0. You may teleport at most k times.

Return the minimum total cost to reach cell (m - 1, n - 1) from (0, 0).



Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3,3],[2,5,4],[4,3,5]], k = 2

Output: 7

Explanation:

Initially we are at (0, 0) and cost is 0.

Current Position	Move	New Position	Total Cost
(0, 0)	Move Down	(1, 0)	0 + 2 = 2
(1, 0)	Move Right	(1, 1)	2 + 5 = 7
(1, 1)	Teleport to (2, 2)	(2, 2)	7 + 0 = 7
The minimum cost to reach bottom-right cell is 7.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], k = 1

Output: 9

Explanation:

Initially we are at (0, 0) and cost is 0.

Current Position	Move	New Position	Total Cost
(0, 0)	Move Down	(1, 0)	0 + 2 = 2
(1, 0)	Move Right	(1, 1)	2 + 3 = 5
(1, 1)	Move Down	(2, 1)	5 + 4 = 9
The minimum cost to reach bottom-right cell is 9.



Constraints:

2 <= m, n <= 80
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 104
0 <= k <= 10
