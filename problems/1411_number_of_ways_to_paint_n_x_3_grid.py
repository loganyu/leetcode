'''
You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.



Example 1:


Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214


Constraints:

n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000

'''

class Solution:
    def numOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        A = B = 6

        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            A, B = (2*A + 2*B) % MOD, (2*A + 3*B) % MOD

        return (A + B) % MOD
