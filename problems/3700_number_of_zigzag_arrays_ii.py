'''
You are given three integers n, l, and r.

A ZigZag array of length n is defined as follows:

Each element lies in the range [l, r].
No two adjacent elements are equal.
No three consecutive elements form a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence.
Return the total number of valid ZigZag arrays.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A sequence is said to be strictly increasing if each element is strictly greater than its previous one (if exists).

A sequence is said to be strictly decreasing if each element is strictly smaller than its previous one (if exists).



Example 1:

Input: n = 3, l = 4, r = 5

Output: 2

Explanation:

There are only 2 valid ZigZag arrays of length n = 3 using values in the range [4, 5]:

[4, 5, 4]
[5, 4, 5]
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, l = 1, r = 3

Output: 10

Explanation:

​​​​​​​There are 10 valid ZigZag arrays of length n = 3 using values in the range [1, 3]:

[1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 1], [1, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [2, 3, 2]
[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3], [3, 2, 3]
All arrays meet the ZigZag conditions.



Constraints:

3 <= n <= 109
1 <= l < r <= 75​​​​​​​
