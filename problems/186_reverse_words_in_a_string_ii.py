'''
Given an input string , reverse the string word by word. 

Example:

Input:  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
Note: 

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
The words are always separated by a single space.
Follow up: Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
