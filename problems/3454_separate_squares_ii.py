You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.

Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares below the line.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.



Example 1:

Input: squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]

Output: 1.00000

Explanation:



Any horizontal line between y = 1 and y = 2 results in an equal split, with 1 square unit above and 1 square unit below. The minimum y-value is 1.

Example 2:

Input: squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]

Output: 1.00000

Explanation:



Since the blue square overlaps with the red square, it will not be counted again. Thus, the line y = 1 splits the squares into two equal parts.



Constraints:

1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 104
squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]
squares[i].length == 3
0 <= xi, yi <= 109
1 <= li <= 109
The total area of all the squares will not exceed 1015.
