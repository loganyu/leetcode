'''
The diameter of a tree is the number of edges in the longest path in that tree.

There is an undirected tree of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D array edges where edges.length == n - 1 and edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return the diameter of the tree.



Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.
Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.


Constraints:

n == edges.length + 1
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
