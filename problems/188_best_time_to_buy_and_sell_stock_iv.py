'''
Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if n < 2:
            return 0
        if k >= n // 2:
            profit = 0
            for i in range(1, len(prices)):
                if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                    profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
            
            return profit
        
        profits = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(k+1)]
        for i in range(1, k+1):
            temp_max = -prices[0]
            for j in range(1, n):
                profits[i][j] = max(profits[i][j-1], prices[j] + temp_max)
                temp_max = max(temp_max, profits[i-1][j-1] - prices[j])
            
        return profits[k][n-1]
