'''
Two images A and B are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

Example 1:

Input: A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],
            [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We slide A to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
Notes: 

1 <= A.length = A[0].length = B.length = B[0].length <= 30
0 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1

    def largestOverlap(self, A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dim = len(A)
        def shift_and_count(x_shift, y_shift, M, R):
            left_shift_count, right_shift_count = 0, 0
            for r_row, m_row in enumerate(range(y_shift, dim)):
                for r_col, m_col in enumerate(range(x_shift, dim)):
                    if M[m_row][m_col] == 1 and M[m_row][m_col] == R[r_row][r_col]:
                        left_shift_count += 1
                    if M[m_row][r_col] == 1 and M[m_row][r_col] == R[r_row][m_col]:
                        right_shift_count += 1

            return max(left_shift_count, right_shift_count)

        max_overlaps = 0
        for y_shift in range(0, dim):
            for x_shift in range(0, dim):
                max_overlaps = max(max_overlaps, shift_and_count(x_shift, y_shift, A, B))
                max_overlaps = max(max_overlaps, shift_and_count(x_shift, y_shift, B, A))
