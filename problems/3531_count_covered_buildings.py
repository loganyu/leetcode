'''
You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].

A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.



Example 1:



Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,2])
below ([3,2])
left ([2,1])
right ([2,3])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
Example 2:



Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]

Output: 0

Explanation:

No building has at least one building in all four directions.
Example 3:



Input: n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only building [3,3] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,3])
below ([5,3])
left ([3,2])
right ([3,5])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.


Constraints:

2 <= n <= 105
1 <= buildings.length <= 105
buildings[i] = [x, y]
1 <= x, y <= n
All coordinates of buildings are unique.
