'''
Given a binary string s (a string consisting only of '0's and '1's), we can split s into 3 non-empty strings s1, s2, s3 (s1+ s2+ s3 = s).

Return the number of ways s can be split such that the number of characters '1' is the same in s1, s2, and s3.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four ways to split s in 3 parts where each part contain the same number of letters '1'.
"1|010|1"
"1|01|01"
"10|10|1"
"10|1|01"
Example 2:

Input: s = "1001"
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: s = "0000"
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to split s in 3 parts.
"0|0|00"
"0|00|0"
"00|0|0"
Example 4:

Input: s = "100100010100110"
Output: 12
 

Constraints:

s[i] == '0' or s[i] == '1'
3 <= s.length <= 10^5

class Solution:
    def numWays(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        ones = []
        total = 0
        for i, val in enumerate(s):
            if val == '1':
                ones.append(i)
                total += 1
        if total == 0:
            return ((n-1)*(n-2)//2) % (10**9+7) 
        if total % 3 != 0:
            return 0
        target = total // 3
        
        return (ones[target]-ones[target-1])*(ones[target*2]-ones[target*2-1])%(10**9+7)
