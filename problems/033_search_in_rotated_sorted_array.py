'''
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        l = 0
        r = n-1
        
        while (l <= r):
            m = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            elif nums[l] <= nums[m]:
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[m]:
                    r = m - 1
                else:
                    l = m + 1
            else:
                if nums[m] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = m + 1
                else:
                    r = m - 1
        
        return -1
