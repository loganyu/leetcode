'''
There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.

You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the minimum time in seconds when you can start moving to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an adjacent room. Moving between adjacent rooms takes exactly one second.

Return the minimum time to reach the room (n - 1, m - 1).

Two rooms are adjacent if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.



Example 1:

Input: moveTime = [[0,4],[4,4]]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The minimum time required is 6 seconds.

At time t == 4, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
At time t == 5, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in one second.
Example 2:

Input: moveTime = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The minimum time required is 3 seconds.

At time t == 0, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
At time t == 1, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in one second.
At time t == 2, move from room (1, 1) to room (1, 2) in one second.
Example 3:

Input: moveTime = [[0,1],[1,2]]

Output: 3



Constraints:

2 <= n == moveTime.length <= 50
2 <= m == moveTime[i].length <= 50
0 <= moveTime[i][j] <= 109
