/*
 * A square triple (a,b,c) is a triple where a, b, and c are integers and a2 + b2 = c2.

Given an integer n, return the number of square triples such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n.



Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5).
Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5), (4,3,5), (6,8,10), and (8,6,10).


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 250
