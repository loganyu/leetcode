'''
Given a binary string s, return the number of substrings with all characters 1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.



Example 1:

Input: s = "0110111"
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.
"1" -> 5 times.
"11" -> 3 times.
"111" -> 1 time.
Example 2:

Input: s = "101"
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.
Example 3:

Input: s = "111111"
Output: 21
Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.

class Solution:
    def numSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        total, consecutive = 0, 0
        length = len(s)
        for i in range(length):
            if s[i] == "0":
                total += consecutive * (consecutive + 1) // 2
                consecutive = 0
            else:
                consecutive += 1

        total += consecutive * (consecutive + 1) // 2
        total %= 10**9 + 7
        return total
