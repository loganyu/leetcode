'''
Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
Example 3:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
Example 4:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 8
 

Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 105
data[i] is 0 or 1.

    def minSwaps(self, data: List[int]) -> int:
        ones = sum(data)
        one_count = max_count = 0
        left = right = 0
        while right < len(data):
            one_count += data[right]
            right += 1
            if right - left > ones:
                one_count -= data[left]
                left += 1
            max_count = max(max_count, one_count)
        
        return ones - max_count
